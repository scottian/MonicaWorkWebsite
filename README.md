Begun in 2016 and worked part time through 2017, the will be the website, the face, of Monica's Company. Spent muuch of last couple months working on getting a home testing server going (I failed), and then trying to find a way to make page on WordPress and not suck (again, failed, but I blame WordPress). 
Currently (201711) working on updating pages to Bootstrap4, trying to get text of pages from the appropriate personnel (Still full of Lorus Ipsum, and getting what I have posted to the web. Oh, and also want to set print versions of web pages before post. We'll See.
